# Active-power-decoupling-using-Single-phase-switched-Boost-Converter- 
Single phase switched Boost Inverter is boost type inverter which can boost the AC output voltage without using and boost circuit but the circuit has low harmonic power component whuch failure to appliance which are going to conncet with SBI, so we are active power decoupling to remove lower harmonic.
